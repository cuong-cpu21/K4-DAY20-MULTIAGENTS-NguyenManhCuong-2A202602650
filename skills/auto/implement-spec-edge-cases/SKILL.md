description: Apply when writing numerical, string parsing, or data formatting code to handle all required edge cases and rounding rules accurately.
---
1. Parse string formats thoroughly: handle thousands separators, currency symbols, and accounting negative notation with parentheses.
2. Perform exact financial and decimal arithmetic using explicit rounding modes (e.g., `decimal.ROUND_HALF_UP`) during quantization.
3. Check boundary conditions precisely (e.g., strictly below `<` versus less than or equal to `<=`).
4. Apply sorting requirements accurately (e.g., case-insensitive sorting using key functions like `key=str.lower`).
5. Ensure CSV escaping and quoting standards (e.g., RFC 4180 quotes for strings with commas or double quotes) are strictly respected.
